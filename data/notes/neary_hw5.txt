==================================== General Notes ===================================

Making edits to the loop variable of a for loop, especially ones that look like a 
condition update similar to what you must do in a while loop are definitely extraneous

You really take the "one letter variable names are bad" rule for granted until you
have to read 500 some assignments in one pass.

================================ Specific Assignments ================================

Consecutive similar conditions could be considered an extraneous line of code
     - See hw5_100.py.

Some students are confusing while and for loops. In their for loop, they are uselessly
incrementing a counter, which is not necessary in python.
     - hw5_115.py

Students feel the need to initialize the variable used in a for loop prior to the 
declaration of the for loop. This is clearly extraneous, and shows a misunderstanding
of of a for loop works in Python.
     - hw5_102.py
     - hw5_140.py

Students use the range() function often with an explicit start are 0. By default,
range(0,10)and range(10) produce the same list. This has no effect on how it runs,
but doesn't necessarily demonstrate an understanding on the range function. Not sure
if this should be included or not.
     - hw5_123.py
     - hw5_155.py
     - hw5_156.py
     - hw5_175.py
     - lots more, I stopped adding them

if <cond> :
   	<code>
else:
	if <cond2>:
		<code>
	else:
		<code>

The above is extraneous, showing lack of understanding of the if-elif-else construct.
As seen in:
     - hw5_133.py

Casting a call to input() with str() shows a lack of understanding of the return type
of input(), which returns a string in Python3 rendering a cast to str() unecessary. 
As seen in:
     - hw5_139.py
     - hw5_159.py

hw5_16.py ... would you consider the use of range here extraneous?

hw5_173.py ... I would consider this extraneous, maybe slight misconception on
the purpose of functions? I will not be looking for this with the method that I come
up with. 

hw5_176.py ... reassigning the for loop variable to be something completely different
10000% extraneous reassignment of the loop variable to something else, but then
just pritning that something else and enver using the looop variable again. clear
misunderstanding of something but I can't quite articulate what. ugh. 

hw5_178.py ... honestly what even why. defines a fucntion within an function, and then
just calls it once. clearly misunderstood functions and their purpose, not sure how to
handle this one.
