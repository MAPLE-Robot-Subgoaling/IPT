==================================== General Notes ===================================

Mostly the same extraneous ines of code, I can't imagine finding any more than what I 
have already noted below. 

...are too many inline comments, like one on every single line, considered extraneous?
	ugh.
	
================================ Specific Assignments ================================

After the loop to produce the hailstone, some students check to see if the variable 
is 1 before printing out something. This is an extraneous line of code because is is always
true that the variable will be 1, that is the condition that the loop must stop on. 
     - hw4_103.py
     - hw4_104.py
     - hw4_123.py
     - hw4_132.py

Explicitly casting a single number to a string before printing out that number 
is unecessary, python takes cast of that cast implicitly. This shows a misunderstanding of
how the print function works.
     - hw4_106.py

An else clause that is unecessary, because a number can be either even or odd. There is no
third option.
     - hw4_118.py


The first condition of the for loop within the while loop is NEVER True. Perhaps a 
misunderstanding of logic here, very weird extraneous check.
     - hw4_127.py

The elif condition is the exact opposite of the if condition, which is the same thing
as just writing an else. I would consider this to be extraneous.
     - hw4_133.py
     - hw4_138.py
     - hw4_139.py


hw4_143.py ... welp, nothing extraneous really just a completely flawed way to do it.

hw4_169.py ... code could be condensed very easily. I consider this a logic error not 
extraneos, however I am making a note of it for a potential future paper
