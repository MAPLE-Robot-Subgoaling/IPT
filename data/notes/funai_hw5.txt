==================================== General Notes ===================================

A LOT of students had logical errors that didn't consider the case where width is 1 and
the height is NOT 1.

so for example, if the user inputs width 1 and height 3 with outline symbol of x
students code will show:                            instead of:
                          x                                      x
                          xx                                     x
                          x                                      x

================================ Specific Assignments ================================

unnecessary cast of str() with input()
    - hw5_203.py
	
logical error: not sure why they set a condition based on boxWidth when the range deals 
with boxHeight, I’m assuming this is a mistake. This code would also give an error if 
the user inputs a width of 1
    - hw_209.py

logical errors: would give wrong answer is height = 2 or if width = 1 due to errors in 
the 2nd if statement and the 3rd if statement
    - hw_211.py

unnecessarily initialization of a variable to use in for, unnecessary casting of list()
    - hw_213.py

logical error: would give wrong result if width is 1 and height is anything other than 1
    - hw_214.py
    - hw_236.py
    - hw_237.py
    - hw_238.py
    - hw_250.py
    - hw_251.py
    - hw_252.py
    - hw_253.py
    - hw_254.py
    - stopped keeping track of these..
    
logical error:  in the for i in range (0, height): the elif with i !=height is unnecessary 
because that will always be true. they might have meant height-1. Also, if/elif/if shows 
possible misunderstanding of if/elif/else
    - hw5_217.py

very inefficient coding with errors.  first for loop with range(width+1) would give one 
more than necessary. Also confused why they decided to print the middle and x as they 
go through the second for loop? Having 3 for loops for this problem is excessive
    - hw5_220.py

extraneous to have a for loop with range(1)
    - hw5_221.py
    - hw5_294.py

unnecessary initialization of variables to 0 prior to input(), logic error would give 
wrong answer if width is 1
    - hw5_231.py

logical errors: only works if height and width aren’t 1, also ...the directions 
explicitly say not to use any while loops...and they used only while loops
    - hw5_235.py

seems excessive to turn everything into a list and solve the problem that way. 
not sure if that’s extraneous or just differing opinions on how to solve it
    - hw_239.py
    - hw_244.py

student set range to (0, height, 1), setting the start and step were unnecessary 
because it defaults at 0 and 1. shows potential misunderstanding of range
     - hw_266.py
     - hw_267.py
     
unnecessary to initailize a variable to represent the range(heightNum)
     - hw_285.py
     
function definitions within a function seems extraneous, could have easily solved
the problem without it....could be treated similarly to hw_178.py?
     - hw_297.py
